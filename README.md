# Debug Tools

The Debug Tools package contains assets and scripts for debugging Unity projects. Included in the package are scripts for enhanced console logging, comparing performance, displaying framerate, and more.

Import the package namespace in each class/script you want to use it. You may need to regenerate project files/assemblies first.
